**Visualization of Sorting Algorithms**

This project provides an interactive 3D visualization of popular sorting algorithms which includes Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort. Built using the Three.js library, the project showcases how these algorithms work step-by-step in an engaging and visually appealing way.

The visualizations are hosted on webpages, making it easy to view and understand the sorting processes in action.


**NOTE** :

This is a rough , functional project and has some obvious issues with it such as elements alignments as such because I only had about 2-3 months to finish it.
Make any desired changes according to your requirements.
